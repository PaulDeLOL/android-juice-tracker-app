Juice Tracker App
==================================

Code for the Android Basics with Compose: Juice Tracker app, built for the Views and Compose assignment for COP4656 - Mobile Programming. It allows the user to add a juice item to a list, specifying its name, a short description, its color, and a rating out of 5 stars. The user can edit pre-existing juices on the list and the list persists across runs. The app has a small advertisement banner on the top to showcase test ads, and completely integrates Android Views and Compose together.
